ffmpeg -i input.mp4  \
-vcodec mpeg2video \ 
-s 1920x1080 \ #resolution
-bufsize 4096k \
-maxrate 20000k \ #max bit rate
-qscale:v 2 \ #To maintain the quality q = 1 - 31 ( Should be less that 4/5 for good quality )
-c:a mp2 \ # For audio stream, can keep as copy ( see examples for copy audio stream ) 
-f vob output.mpg # vob is output used specific for mpeg2

For Home DVD: (Cause above command didn't worked out, keeping just for reference ) 
ffmpeg -i .inputmp4 \
        -target pal-dvd 
        -aspect 4:3 # TV is not LCD / LED hence 4:3 else 16:9 recommended
        -b:v 8000k 
        -minrate 6000k #IF 8000k was enforeced, the coloring sucked!
        -maxrate 8000k 
        -bufsize 4500k 
        -vsync 0    #For supressing the duplicate frames.
